# AI-Therapist

One of the advantages of CBT, as opposed to many other forms of therapy, is that the process lends itself to automation. This is because the research effort over the past 40 years has developed well defined strategies and procedures that can be codified into a rigorous treatment program. Computerized CBT is able to administer the full course of a CBT treatment without the involvement of a therapist. The core concepts behind CBT are taught to the user via text, audio and video instructions. Advanced systems, such as AI-Therapy's Overcome Social Anxiety, are built upon a database of carefully collected domain knowledge. This information is used to automatically identify the user's specific unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. Finally, the online system tailors a treatment program specifically towards the user. For example, the treatment may include thought-challenging experiments determined based on the patient's reported symptoms.

Introduction: Our program has a variety of features and we plan to implement more. 

1. Content Recommendations -> User will input how his/her day went in a few sentences. Using natural language processing, we will detect how the user is feeling and respond sympathetically as well as use a recommender system to show them content that will help. For example, if the user is feeling anxious/worried we will show them meditation/yoga content, breathing exercises, etc. 

2. CBT Program -> We have a customized plan tailored to treat anxiety and depression using cognitive behavioral therapy tools. The user is guided through a series of lessons to effectively target symptoms & learn new lessons.
